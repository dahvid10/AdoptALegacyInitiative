# Adopt-a-Legacy Initiative
The Adopt-a-Legacy Initiative (ALI) connects African diaspora families with families in Africa to foster cultural exchange, promote understanding of heritage, and strengthen community ties while addressing the legacies of colonialism.

- African individuals and families in diaspora will match with a family on the continent.
- Historical information will be exchanged between the families.
- The adoption period will take a minimum of 1 year.
- Diaspora can opt to determine a match by DNA or by region of interest.
- Adoption will allow the diaspora to use the African's family name.
- Adoption will allow the diaspora to include or exclude the colonial name.
- Financial contributions can be optional, but encourage respectful exchanges.
- Cultural differences will engage all parties during the adoption period.
- Discuss family traditions, moral standards, and sexuality among other social trends.
- Refrain from financial coercion.
- The eldest members of the family will be involved during the adoption period.
- Both parties must collaborate and draft an agreement that details both parties' historical context, exchanges, and familial standards prior to adoption.
- Local governments for both parties will publish the agreements on the day of adoption.
- Ensure all communication represents all tribes.
